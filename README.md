 ### Here is one of my first attempts at creating a website. This is the portal for a dog trainer.

### Structure :

- Home Page
- Registration form
- Image Gallery
- Page of services 
- privacy policies and legal notices

## Work in progress

This project is **far from the end**. The homepage needs to be *revised*, the form needs to be formatted, and the overall design is less than passable.<br>
I had a lot of fun learning about CSS and Javascript to format the gallery, wich was the beginning of the project (it then became a website when I showed it to a friend). <br>
The services page is empty and I haven't decided on the general layout yet, which leads to the next line.<br>
I might come back to the general design to create a more **dynamic** page as opposed to the stacking of html files here.<br>
So far I've only used the classic trio, **HTML/CSS/JS**.<br>
I plan to learn the frameworks needed to create modern pages (vue.js, React.js, ... idk yet).<br>
For the Back-end part I still have many things to explore in depth.<br>
<br>
#### This project is therefore rooted in the desire to create this site for a real person. However, it is a project without a deadline. If I succeed in my goals, one day or another, the final version will indeed be online.

### To be continued...
